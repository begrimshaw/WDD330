    <h1>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I've used the window object a couple of times. Manly to add a function
        or variable to it. I know that the window object is default in all
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object
      </li>
      <li>Manipulate the window and/or screen that the browser is using</li>
      <li>contains cookie information</li>
      <li>
        Timing functions allow you to manipulate a certain amount of time that
        has passed. I've had a lot of questions about how to manipulate time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Animation: The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to
        animate elements on a web page.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Chapter 14: HTML5 API</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Newest version of HTMl</li>
      <li>
        data- attribute will allow you to embed data in a web page using custom
        attributes that are ignored by the browser. Used to identify particular
        elements. Ex: data-dropdown could identify the dropdown menu
      </li>
      <li>Ability to use local and session storage</li>
      <li>
        Geolocation API can obtain the geographical position of the device. Can
        be used to find the user's exact location then link to nearby placfes or
        measure the speed that the user is moving. Permission to use this must
        first be granted by the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        Geolocation is a property of the navigator object. Ex:
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere); With the
        youAreHere being a callback function after retrieving the position
      </li>
      <li>
        The position can then return the longitutde and latitude, the speed, the
        altitude, heading, and timestap of the device.
      </li>
      <li>
        I honestly didn't know that all of that information was capable of being
        used by anybody. How would I implement it? How would I have to get the
        "device permission"?
      </li>
