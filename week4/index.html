    <h3>Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Just starting off with this chapter, I wonder when it is best to use a form and when to use an "onclick" or event listner fucntion. Last week they mentioned 
            to never use onclick so when should I use a form verse an event listner? 
        </li>
        <li>the "action" attribute is the url where we want the form to be submitted. In other words the file where the form data will be sent. </li>
        <li>Is getting an element by the document form a better way to getElementById?</li>
        <li>It says that a form.submit() won't trigger a form submit event.. I thought that was the whole point of the submit function. To submit and call the cunction 
            attached. 
        </li>
        <li>There are so many options for forms and types of inputs/ images/ submits. It would be nice to have each tag laid out with all of its options underneath it. </li>
        <li>I do not understand this line of code: "hero.powers = [...form.powers].filter(box => box.checked).map(box => box.value);" I understand what it is doing but it 
            seems really complicated to come up with for one line. In the filter() function, where is "box" coming from? It is clearly in the function and can call box.checked 
            but where does it come from as the parameter?
        </li>
        <li>In my backend web class we use "hidden" input fields a lot to pass values from one page to another. I'm not sure why we can't export these values though
            so I would like to understand how hidden works more. 
        </li>
        <li>I should also remember that just because the input field is hidden doesn't mean it can hide sensitive data. It is clearly visible in the html.</li>
        <li>I can make it necessary for a field to be filled in by adding "required" into the attribute lists</li>

        
    </ul>

    <h3>Chapter 12: object Oriented Programming</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Encapsulation: Do things behind the scenes</li>
        <li>Polymorphism: Similar features with different functionalities</li>
        <li>Inheritance: Use the same features with a couple more added.</li>
        <li>I understand what a constructor function does.. however I know that you don't always need one. When should I be using one and when do I not need one?</li>
        <li>a static method is called by the class itself instead of instances of the class. </li>
        <li>A class.prototype on a class will allow you to add methods and attributes. Not sure when this would be used over just adding it in the main class.  </li>
        <li>I don't think I really understand prototypes yet</li>
        <li>Public and Private also sound a lot like a normal method and a static method. </li>
        <li>I remember using getters and setters in C++ a lot. Should they always be used on public functions? </li>
        <li>Using extends seems a lot more like Inheritance was in c++. Where I could use the previous classes functions but also add some of my owne</li>
        <li>Getters and setters go insdie the class and reference a value inside the class.</li>
        <li>So mixins let you add functions at will to a class? Can we mixin objects and combine all of the classes? </li>
        <li>Using popular libraries make it so that many people can understand your code</li> 
        <li>However, libraries increase the amount of code needed and therefore can slow down the performance of the website</li>
        <li>Vanilla Js website shoes all the pros of not using libraries and similar code that can be written for quicker performance.</li>
        <li>Using a library means that you have to learn the libaries notation before using it.</li>
        <li>Models allow for parts of the code to be in separate files.</li>
        <li>Modlues "export" something out of the file to be used by other files (i.e. export product model to shop page)</li>
        <li>MVS is model, view, controller. The model talks to the data, the view talks to the user, and the controller communicates data between the model and the view</li>
        <li>There are a number of frameworks that help out with MVC to reduce the amount of code needed</li>
        <li>Templates alos help pass data. (i.e. ejs, handlebars)</li>
        

    </ul>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What is the difference between an onsubmit=function() and an action="/home/...etc? What if a form has both of those? </li>
    <li>What is a high level overview of Polymorphism vs Inheritance? I feel like they are very similar. </li>
    <li>When should I use a static method? It says it is called by the class itself instead of instances of the class.. Will the instances not be able to access 
        that method? How would it get called?    
    </li>
    <li>I don't understand what a prototype is. What is the difference between a prototype and a class inheriting another class? </li>
</ul>
