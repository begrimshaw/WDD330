    <h3>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I have never been good at testing and debugging. The only "debugging" i have done is when I get an error I look at the line and can walk through the code 
            to figure out why that line is wrong. 
        </li>
        <li>Stack Trace: sequence of functions/methods that lead to the error. I'm not sure I have recognized this. I feel like the error is usually what shoes up alone</li>
        <li>Importance: need to make sure the code fails and notifies us if it does but without affecting the user experience. </li>
        <li>There is a "strict mode" that will produce more exceptions and warnings so you can catch errors early on. It even doesn't allow sloppy code practices</li>
        <li>To use strict mode add " 'use strict'; " to the first line in a javaScript file</li>
        <li>You can also 'use strict' just inside a specific function by putting it on the first line of that function instead</li>
        <li>"Linting tools (JS Lint, JS Hint, ES Lint) can test the quality of JS code. They highlihgt sloppy practices, syntax errors, and certain style 
            conventions. They can also enforce style guide. They are very unforgiving. 
        </li>
        <li>I've heard of "linting" from small references on linkdin and around the community but I never knew what it actually was</li>
        <li>Feature detection: the recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. Use an if statement to check whether an 
            object or method exists before trying to call the method. This makes sure that no matter what browser the user has we can check to see if a feature will work</li>
        <h4>Debugging</h4>
        <li>there is always the alert() method to show a dialog during certain points of code. It stops the program from running until OK is clicked so we can put
            breakpoints in the code. 
        </li>
        <li>Another way of debugging is using the console. console.log() will output anything we tell it to. console.trace() will show the stack trace of the functions that were 
            called in the lead up to that exception
        </li>
        <li>putting in the word "debugger;" in your code will cause a breakpoint in the browser and pause the code while you can hover over variables and check their values.
            should remember to remove all of those lines before the final product is released
        </li>
        <li>there are a number of error objectst that can be used for specific errors</li>
        <li>JS throws exceptions when it finds errors but we can manually invoke an excep[tion but the 'throw' statement. If something is thrown the code will stop executing
            it is best practice to throw an error object. 
        </li>
        <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
        <li>During development, when a program throws an exception we can go and fix the exception. In production however we do not want the program to break. This is fixed 
            through execption handling. It will had any errors from the users but still identify that there is an error. 
        </li>
        <li>If a piece of code may end in an exception we put it inside a try, catch. The try will run the code like normal and skip the catch if everything works. If there 
            is an error then the catch will execute other code. There is also a 'finally' that will be ran no matter what. 
        </li>
        <h4>Tests</h4>
        <li>Simple tests on functions. We deliberatly pass values in instead of waiting for user input to make sure that they are working correctly</li>
        <li>There are also testing framworks in JS that make it easy to cretae and run tests. </li>



    </ul>
