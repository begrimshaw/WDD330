    <h1>Week 2 readings</h1>

    <h3>Chapter 2: programming basics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I didn't know that JS didn't require semi colons. I think I will continue to do it for good practice though</li>
        <li><ul>words reserved by JS<li>abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield</li></ul></li>
        <li>Declare using let and const instead of var</li>
        <li>still use camel case for bariable naming</li>
        <li>All of the friendly string functions I wish I could keep in a list. I don't have them memorized and I feel like it limits my thinking.</li>
        <li>I just had to use a template literal this last week and didn't understand what it did. Now I get it a little more. It's good for using
            js code inside the string as well as using both types of quotation marks although I think the first is more common. 
        </li>
        <li>I've never heard of a "symbol". </li>
        <li>Also constructor functions have always confused me. </li>
        <li>Most of the rest is review. I found a couple functions useful like converting strings to numbers. </li>
        <li>Parsing is something I have barely done and never really understood. <br> It looks like parsing is used to extract a piece out of a whole.</li>
        <li>Although I have used "hard" and "soft" equality before, I never knew what the difference was. <br> 
            hard equality: returns true only if data type is the same as well. <br>
            soft equality: Just checking to see if it is the same. 5 and "5" are the same in soft
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I am actual confused by the example under "Direct Assignment and Assingment by Reference in chapter 2. It creates "c" as an object and then says "let d = c". 
            That should create a new object of c as d. Then it says if I do d.value it will also change the c.value. Isn't d a new object? So it should reference the features 
            of c but not change c itself?<br>
            It looks like i has to do with primitive and non-primitive. Maybe I'm not use to it from other languages.
