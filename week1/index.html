    <h1>Week 1 Notes and Observations</h1>
    <ul> 
        <li> I've taken a database class but never really learned
            how to apply it in an application. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If I'm being honest this example seems very easy so far. This would have been a very nice
            resource when I was starting out though. It took a lot of googling to learn and this has 
            a very simple explanation. 
        </li>
        <li>I still enjoy the coding and practice. I feel like it will help me get much more fluent 
            and I'd like to keep doing practice like this. 
        </li>
        <li>I do need to remember the difference between .value and .innerHTML. <br>
        .value is used for input and text areas. <br>
        .innerHTML is used for sections and other tags
        </li>
        <li>the localStorage part of the JS is also brand new to me. I believe I used it for 
            an app many semesters ago.
        </li>
        <li>
            Here is a <a href="story_editor.html">link</a> to my story editor page. 
        </li>
        <li>Here is a <a href="even_or_odd.html">link</a> to even or odd exercise.</li>
    </ul>
