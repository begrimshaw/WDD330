    <h1>Week 1 Notes and Observations</h1>
    <h3>Doing stuff with web things</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li> I've taken a database class but never really learned
            how to apply it in an application. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If I'm being honest this example seems very easy so far. This would have been a very nice
            resource when I was starting out though. It took a lot of googling to learn and this has 
            a very simple explanation. 
        </li>
        <li>I still enjoy the coding and practice. I feel like it will help me get much more fluent 
            and I'd like to keep doing practice like this. 
        </li>
        <li>I do need to remember the difference between .value and .innerHTML. <br>
        .value is used for input and text areas. <br>
        .innerHTML is used for sections and other tags
        </li>
        <li>the localStorage part of the JS is also brand new to me. I believe I used it for 
            an app many semesters ago.
        </li>
        <li>JSON stringify and parse should be looked into more. I haven't used those in a while and I don't know what they do.</li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Here is a <a href="story_editor.html">link</a> to my story editor page.</li>
                <li>Here is a <a href="even_or_odd.html">link</a> to even or odd exercise.</li>
                <li>Here is a <a href="note_it.html">link</a> to journal exercise.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Master Mobile UX</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobile tracking has skyrocketed</li>
        <li>"Whatever you are doing, do mobile first"</li>
        <li>Just because a website is responsive, doesn't mean it is "mobile first"</li>
        <ul>Mobile first
            <li>time consuming</li>
            <li>provides best experience</li>
            <li>plans for the future and read for growth</li>
        </ul>
        <li>desktop computer sales continually sink. Laptops have taken over computers</li>
        <li>Start small and scale up. Concentrate on content and functionality</li>
        <h3>Understand users</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus groups don't always work. People don't know what they want until they have it</li>
            <li>Be there. Help them</li>
            <li>Be useful. People should not need to hunt through the website. Provide what they came for</li>
            <li>Be quick. Attention span is short. user shouldn't notice</li>
            <li>make it easy for users to reach things while using their phones. Many people use a one handed grip
                this pretty much means don't put common buttons on the top.</li>
            <li>If things load quickly, people are a lot more likely to stay</li>
            <li>Biggest contributor to speed is networks</li>
           <h4>Speed</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce image usage</li>
                <li>lower bandwidth</li>
               <li> optimize and minify css and js files. Including eliminating whitespace. </li> 
            </ul>

        </ul>
        <h3>Primary controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Put controls on the bottom of the screen where it is easy for thumbs to reach</li>
            <li>Example of this is instagram (not facebook)</li>
            <li>Having a "menu" wrapped in border and not a hamburger button is much easier for users</li>
            <li>Users won't often complain, they will just leave the sit</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mobile Inputs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Make forms easier. Ditch labels and put text inside the input field</li>
            <li>make input box larger so it is easier to hit with a thumb.</li>
            <li>make checkboxes larger as well</li>
            <li>Eliminate the necessity of long forms</li>
            <li>if a long form is necessary. Then divide the form up into different sections</li>
            <li>If form is long, enable "autocomplete" on the form. </li>
            <li>Another type of input is "passwords"</li>
            <li>one way is to show the password by default, keep option to hide but most people aren't being snooped on</li>
            <li>Space credit card information correctly. </li>
            <li>give users the best keyboard for inputs. If you are asking for a phone number, only bring up the number pad instead of the
                regular keyboard
            </li>
            <li>link phone numbers instead of making them copy and paste the numbers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mobile Advertising</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ad spending went from 25billion to 150billion in a 5 year period ending in 2017</li>
            <li>Never do a pop up add. One of the most detested things on the web</li>
            <li>Ads should be small and simple. Should not take up 40% of the mobile screen</li>
            <li>A larger add could be revealed once clicked. But keep add small. </li>
            <li>could have an add behind the page with a little window that shows the background when scrolled</li>
            <li>Users don't visit your website to look at ads. Give them what they came for and then you can advertise to them</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

 

    <h2>Week 1 questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Why do many companies still prioritize ads over content? Do they not care about the user? There are many websites that I know just show me ads
            and because of that I never click on them for content. isn't that counterintuitive? 
        </li>
    </ol>
