    <h1>Client-side Form Validation</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ensures that all required form controls are filled out before the form
        is submitted
      </li>
      <li>
        Allows the user to fix the data right away.. Doesn't feed in bad
        information to the backend
      </li>
      <li>
        Server-side validation is once the data is passed through. Clien-side is
        before it is submitted
      </li>
      <li>
        Goal: Get the data in the right format, protect our users' data, protect
        our program
      </li>
      <li>
        Types of form validation:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Built-in form validation: uses html 5. Not as customizable as JS
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript: coded in JS, completely customizable but needs to be
            created by scratch or pulled in from a library
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <h3>Built in Form Validation:</h3>
      <li>Use validation attributes on form elements</li>
      <li>
        attributes: required, minlength, maxlength, min, max, type, pattern
      </li>
      <li>
        If elemnt is valid it will match a :valid CSS class which allows you to
        apply specific style to valid elements
      </li>
      <li>
        When element is invlaid it will match :invalid CSS class. Browser will
        block the code from being sent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="builtIn.html">Link</a> to a built in form validation example
      </li>
      <li>
        After trying both of those out, I feel like built in form validation is
        much easier. But I understand that there is a lot more customizable
        options with JS.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Using Fetch</h1>
    <h1>API Example</h1>
    <p>
      Here is a <a href="chuckNorrisAPI/api.html">link</a> to a quick API I
      connected to. (Hint: Click the image).
    </p>
    <p>
      Disclaimer: This was a quick API search and I wanted to use fetch for the
      first time... Not all of the "jokes" it generates are clean so I hope you
      get a decent one.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fetch API allows JS to access request and responses</li>
      <li>fetch req just goes to a url and returns a promise.</li>
      <li>
        The response does not contain actual JSON. you must extract the JSON
        from the response
      </li>
      <li>If credentials must be included then they are sent with the req.</li>
      <li>You can "POST" JSON data using fetch as well.</li>
      <li>You can upload a file with fetch</li>
      <li>
        I'm a little confused.. I though fetch() was to link to an API and pull
        data from it.. Why can I know send JSON data and upload files using
        fetch?
      </li>
    </ul>
